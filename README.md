Spytify is a Spotify recorder for Windows which records Spotify audio without recording or playing ads, ensuring no loss in sound quality. It automatically splits songs into separate tracks and records to MP3 with media metadata, meaning you can start easily enjoying your music offline.

Spytify runs on Windows only. Requirements: 
- Microsoft Framework ([.NET 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=17851) or higher)
- Spotify Desktop application

A __free Spotify account will work__, but restricts audio quality to 120 kbps. Having a Premium Spotify subsciption will enable recording of up to 320 kbps audio.

## How it works
Spytify records what your computer's sound card outputs. Spytify records the same quality that Spotify outputs, so the recorded version will be indistinguishable from Spotify's version. Spytify records at .mp3 quality, and not at higher qualities like .FLAC, since Spotify can only deliver 320 kbps audio quality.
